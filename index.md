# About this
The description for the course that brought this portfolio about is as follows: "Critical making is making as scholarship, grounded in the humanities, interweaving design, function, and theory through attention to code, software, and hardware."

[Wikipedia defines critical making](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Critical_making&oldid=1281587504) as:
> the hands-on productive activities that link digital technologies to society. It was invented to bridge the gap between creative, physical, and conceptual exploration. The term "critical making" was popularized by Matt Ratto, an associate professor at the University of Toronto. Ratto describes one of the main goals of critical making as a way "to use material forms of engagement with technologies to supplement and extend critical reflection and, in doing so, to reconnect our lived experiences with technologies to social and conceptual critique."

Our instructor, Emily Kuzneski Johnson, further reminds us that "our focus is on process and inquiry, not just the demonstration of technical skills." (You can read more about the course on [its GitHub Pages site](https://ekjphd.github.io/Critical-Making-Schedule-2025/); she and our program's director, Anastasia Salter, also have a forthcoming book titled [*Critical Making in the Age of AI*](https://services.publishing.umich.edu/Books/C/Critical-Making-in-the-Age-of-AI3) you should check out, as it framed the course!)

Prior, I'd only been exposed to anything like this via [critical game design](https://doi.org/10.1162/desi_e_00702), particularly during my master's program final project titled "Critical Game Design in Tabletop Roleplaying Games: A First-Person Exploration of Scholarly-Informed Development." As I've learned throughout the Spring 2025 semester taking ENG6819: Critical Making for Humanist Scholarship, however, there's plenty we all do throughout our lives that arguably fall into this definition, and much more which could with only minor tweaks. Texts like Sasha Costanza-Chock's [*Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need*](https://designjustice.mitpress.mit.edu/) helped with this by providing a framework for translating our making process into tangible, just outcomes.

In the sidebar—and especially at the [Projects](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/Projects/) page where you'll find more in-depth descriptions—you'll find a series of examples I created as a result of this course exposing me to critical making. Hopefully something inspires you onto a similar project of your own!

## About me
Hello! While I publish/present under J. M. L. Whittington, you may call me Justin (he/they). I was born and raised in West Virginia, only recently moving to Orlando, Florida to enter the [Texts and Technology PhD program ](https://cah.ucf.edu/textstech/) at University of Central Florida as a student.

Here, I also serve as Graduate Research Associate with the [Center for Humanities and Digital Research](https://chdr.cah.ucf.edu/), as well as a Graduate Teaching Assistant - Grader for the [Games and Interactive Media Program](https://communication.ucf.edu/games-and-interactive-media/).

Elsewhere, I'm attached as a Research Assistant to a [John Deaver Drinko Academy Fellowship](https://www.marshall.edu/drinko/) project awarded to Dr. Luke Eric Lassiter of the [Graduate Humanities Program](https://www.marshall.edu/graduatehumanities/) at Marshall University, which I joined during my Master of Arts in Humanities at the same institution.

My work has been featured at (inter)national conferences, including the [Digital Games Research Association](https://digra.org/), [Popular Culture Association](https://pcaaca.org/default.aspx), and [Appalachian Studies Association](https://www.appalachianstudies.org/). I've additionally had my hand over the years in music, game design/development, programming, homelabbing, and language/linguistics, at both professional and hobbyist levels.

I also have a [full regular website](https://jmlwhittington.com/) in case you'd like to explore me further or get in contact!

### Research interests
The blurb I usually give is "sociopolitical phenomena of games and theme parks." Breaking that down more specifically:

In games (video and tabletop):
- Intersections of games with international relations/postcolonialism
- [Appalachian game studies](https://groups.google.com/g/appalachian-game-studies)

In theme parks:
- (Dis)ability and other bodily variation in the theme park
- Transgression in the theme park
- Theme parks as medium, theming as [culturonics](https://filosofia.dickinson.edu/encyclopedia/culturonics/)

A further interest of mine is in [middle-state publishing, feed-forward scholarship](https://www.firstpersonscholar.com/feed-forward-scholarship/), and public (digital) humanities.
