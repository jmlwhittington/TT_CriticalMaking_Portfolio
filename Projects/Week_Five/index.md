Excerpts from the reflection:
> A map such as mine here aims to knit back together mapping and touring, or in strictly verbal and thus ludic terms, "looking and going" [(Lammes 4)](https://doi.org/10.7557/23.6110). It draws attention to the frictions of the experienced space against the observed space. The viewer is reminded that, unlike prior *Fallout* games, Appalachia—specifically West Virginia, but also the entire region by proxy through naming—was the perfect playground (neofrontier) for the franchise's first online multiplayer entry. The inhabitants have and have historically had little voice, after all. And a shame none of the money flowed back into the impoverished region, while its cultural depth and diversity is flattened, occasionally erased! ([Watoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watoga,_West_Virginia) comes to mind, a failed attempt at Black self-determination, [turned into something akin to Walt’s original conception of Epcot, built on the ruins of what is only called a "ghost town" in-game](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Watoga).)

> It is unfortunately that kind of preachy hour. I'll force myself to move through the assignment's requirements. [Johnson and Salter](https://services.publishing.umich.edu/Books/C/Critical-Making-in-the-Age-of-AI3) refer to maps' utility in "communicating important issues to an outside audience" and "how little data is . . . presented to . . . those with authority to improve conditions." They continue on to highlight socioeconomic factors like "education deserts" in mapping. Thus I selected West Virginia's exceptionally high poverty rates to highlight, [at fourth worst in the nation by state and fifth when including Puerto Rico](https://www.fcnl.org/updates/2024-09/top-10-poorest-states-us). I sometimes wonder if the average American really understands that a significant chunk of fellow citizens suffer conditions I've referred to as "the Third World of the First World."

> While I can appreciate *Fallout 76*'s attempt at doing Appalachia justice [(Morrissette)](https://www.firstpersonscholar.com/dark-as-a-dungeon/), I simultaneously can't help but feel as though it glosses over the fact that *these awful things really did happen and are still happening today*. The most engaged players seem to miss this, traveling into and overwhelming communities with a total population of 38 (and dwindling) that didn't have much of a say in their in-game promotion, just to insert themselves into someone else's cultural heritage by merit of enjoying it virtually [(Hilliard 203-206)](https://uncpress.org/book/9781469671628/making-our-future/).
