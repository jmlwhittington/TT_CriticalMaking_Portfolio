Note that the first four weeks featured introductory material week one and three critical making exercises, two of which were done with physical materials. I didn't include these because I wasn't proud of the quality and I don't feel they captured the theme of what I was going for with this portfolio; aka, they were experiments in the truest sense of the word.

Additionally, week 11 was spring break, and the final two weeks of the course have not occurred at the time of this writing. One is also optional and the other is just a reflection essay for the semester.

# [Week 5 — Map](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/Projects/Week_Five/)
My map for this week's exercise was a contextualization of real-world settlements featured in [*Fallout 76*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_76), with poverty rates compared to national and state averages, summaries and population figures, followed by in-game description. It used Google Earth's slideshow feature.

# [Week 6 — Hypertext](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/Projects/Week_Six/index.html)
My work for this week is a little less fiction and a little more play between the elements of agency's freedom and structure’s determinism. Without taking a stance, partly because I don't believe one or the other is entirely correct and rather that there's mutual influence (leaning one way, however...), my [Twine](https://twinery.org/) is a virtual [*I Ching*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching).

Brief instructions:
- Input the question you wish to reflect upon.
- Move onto the determination of the hexagram's first line.
- View the binary representation of the computer's own version of the coin-flip method.
- Decide if you want to accept the line's fate. (You may not have a choice!)
- Repeat the line if you don't (and are allowed to).
- Repeat steps 2-5 until you have six lines.
- Decide if you're ready to see your hexagram. If no, skip to step 10.
- Construct your hexagram and click the link to view its meditative text.
- You may receive what are known as "changing lines." This provides a second hexagram to reflect upon.
- Decide if you want to try again. (You may not have a choice!)

Excerpts from the reflection:
> I've been fascinated with some of the more mystical and esoteric connections with technology over the last year. Some of this stems from work by the [Cybernetic Culture Research Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetic_Culture_Research_Unit) (and not Nick Land specifically, for reasons you'll understand if you dig in deeper, nor do I buy into accelerationism, although they can be used to help map out our world today; mostly I reference Kodwo Eshun and Mark Fisher).

> Still more are my own realizations about the way technology is treated, even revered. [Sometimes coding feels like wizardry](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fwkz1n6t7o8721.png). It's not unusual to hear IT talk about the computer's own will. There's also [Arthur C. Clarke's third law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws): "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

> Finally, I'm inspired by my own belief system that, rather than get into detail about, I’ll leave it here at "in part influenced by Taoism."

> Divination is often an act of deferring to something outside oneself. In the case of the *I Ching*, it's random outcomes, which may or may not be seen as the will of something or another. (For me, it's just numbers.) Often in our classes, agency is a major concern of discussions. "Are computers influencing our actions? How might we resist this?" This has only made divination more fascinating to me. Banks now plug our information into the Almighty Algorithm to produce an answer toward if they're going to take a risk on giving us money. In what way is this any different?

# [Week 7 — Game](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/Projects/Week_Seven/index.html)
This week, I chose to cover the complicated personal relationship with home that's been consuming my thoughts since I left summer 2024. The best way I've summed it up is: "Appalachia can be hard to love right now, but it's easier for me from a distance." The result is a [Bitsy](https://www.bitsy.org/) minigame titled "Don't you want to go home?"

Note the background music, a slowed-down, chiptune rendition of ["Foggy Mountain Breakdown" by bluegrass legend, Earl Scruggs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_Y3mnj-8lA).

# [Week 8 — Grammar](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/Projects/Week_Eight/index.html)
A Tracery generator that riffs off a bot made in another class. It generates [variations of structures put forward in syntactic linguistics to show its separate from semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously). Although, maybe if you go to copy one of your favorites, something magical will happen.

Excerpts from the reflection:
> The whole point of my bot, named ColorlessBlueBotsFlyFuriously, is to challenge the surface level of technology to dig into questions of (human/machine) agency versus (technological) structure. I borrowed the same basic concept here to make a different point tied to [the chapters by Sarkar and Mullaney](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262539739/your-computer-is-on-fire/) (note: 14 and 16).

> "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is a sentence famous linguist Noam Chomsky used to illustrate that linguistic structure is separate from meaning. This was ultimately an attack on the same kinds of attempts to understand language that are now fueling the AI boom, a bit ironic and a fantastic reason to use it here. At the time, however, they weren't producing much fruit, and his work managed to advance us quite a great deal in its place. (Not so much in recent decades. Linguistics has been awaiting a paradigm shift.) The Wikipedia article I linked two others in use here that do the same thing: Lucien Tesnière's "[The real symbol imposes the soothing speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Tesni%C3%A8re#Antinomy_between_structural_and_linear_order)"; and Lev Shcherba's "[The glocky kuzdra shteckly budled the bocker and is kurdyaking the bockerling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glokaya_kuzdra)."

> Confession time: I've never really gotten into these kinds of bots. I use the Chomsky example a little tongue in cheek both here and in another class. That is, to draw attention to the lack of meaning in most of these constructions. But they're pretty popular and can be fun. People like to show off their favorites. One manner of doing this is by copying and pasting the results. What if, when you went to move your mouse over the text, something else revealed itself though, something waiting on the other side that we're only just beginning to understand? It's like breaking through the surface/superficial layer to uncover another truth.

> The subtitle of the page reads "Isn't technology incredible?! Entirely transparent, a window into the world..." Mousing over the generated text to share with your friends changes the text into another random generation. Moving the mouse off the text returns it to what it was originally. These new generations challenge technocratic power in various ways à la Sarkar's chapter. It's almost as if the mask is slipping here and there.

# [Week 9 — Analysis](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/Projects/Week_Nine/index.html)
A blending of [Twine](https://earth.google.com/) and [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) to perform a [distant reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_reading) prototype for differnt translations of the [*Tao Te Ching*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching).

Excerpts from the reflection:
> We did a little work like this last semester in another course, which introduced me to the concept of "[distant reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_reading)," defined here as "computer-assisted analysis" and contrasted with "close reading" ([Johnson and Salter 188](https://services.publishing.umich.edu/Books/C/Critical-Making-in-the-Age-of-AI3)). A few pages later notes how in distant reading: "These metrics are helpful for digging deeper into comparisons between works, authors, time periods, and more" (192). The series toward the end of the sentence got me thinking about translation, specifically in relation to texts where the meaning is less direct and more interpretative.

> The *Tao Te Ching* has been translated a great many times, with the version sitting on my shelf being by Gia-Fu Feng and Jane English. The text's composition has more in common with poetry than one might expect at first glance. Even though the Bible also has beautiful allegorical and prosaic components, one might be able to gloss at least a few intended meanings from serious study of it. The *Tao Te Ching*, coming both from Chinese and an older form at that, can come across as so esoteric, that it might turn off a few readers. (This has led to endless debate and disagreement...mostly amongst Westerners.) Its subject, the Tao, is barely elucidated, because as the text insists, it can't be directly apprehended; rather, its meaning is found through relations. And in the Western context, these come to us through further decontextualized relations: the act of translation itself. No translation is perfect. It's an art form instead of a science.

> I hope to apply the same logic discussed here to a brief analysis of one of the earliest translations of the *Tao Te Ching*, produced 134 years ago. An extended version of such a project may compare multiple translations and a close reading of the original Chinese text, but a look at a single text at a time I believe might instead help elaborate what one is seeking to find between them. At this time, I chose an older translation because of it being the most well-known of older translations, and because I expect it to potentially reveal a degree of Orientalism through the macroscopic lens of distant reading. In fact, having read the Feng and English translation, I'd posit further one could trace a history of Orientalism between these two translations, as Feng and English also do their fair share of exoticization in my opinion.

> On the basis of this hypothesis, I now tie in [D'Ignazio and Klein's article](https://kanarinka.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IEEE_Feminist_Data_Visualization.pdf), "Feminist Data Visualization." First, I can't help but find connections between the projects of feminism and postcolonialism through this sentence in the abstract: "Feminism is not (just) about women, but rather draws our attention to questions of *epistemology*—who is included in dominant ways of producing and communicating knowledge and whose perspectives are marginalized" (1; emphasis added). In much the same way that feminism challenge sex and gender binaries (the latter of which causes me to also link it to queer studies/theory for the sake of this discussion), postcolonialism challenges the oppressor and oppressed binary. The reaching out of feminism here to further challenge any binaries and investigate uneven relationships of power strikes me as something postcolonial theory similarly can apply itself toward.

> As a result, this approach to feminism fits flush with my own questioning of potential Orientalism in *Tao Te Ching* translations. Section 3.4, "Consider Context," further brings up how "all knowledge is *situated*, where 'situated' refers to the particular social, cultural, and material context in which that knowledge is produced" (3; italics original). This is the framing, from the perspective of feminist data visualization, that is employed to ensure that D'Ignazio and Klein's work is respected in this exercise, yet also for compatibility with my own postcolonial lens. In a sense, you can think of me accidentally blending feminism and postcolonialism; I wouldn't be the first, and I'm hesitant to officially label what you see before you as that due to my not being an expert in feminist theory. For my purposes here though, what a nice thing to explore!

# [Week 10 — Generation](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/Projects/Week_Ten/)
This week, I was asked to play with AI and ask it to do things with my research. Given how I've been trying to develop an [Appalachian game studies](https://jmlwhittington.com/resources), and how I've already done a little work with analyzing video game genres through ChatGPT in another class last semester, the connection was clear as day: experiment with how different tools envision an Appalachian video game, and ask those who can talk what went into their design process.

# [Week 12 — Code/Visualization](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/Projects/Week_Twelve/)
First, a modification of a [template provided by the instructor](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1307624), using [p5.js](https://lauren-mccarthy.com/p5-js) and [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/). Second, a text clicker that lets you read short stories by clicking where you want the next word to go, as well as what color and size the words might be.

# [Week 13 — Narrative](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/Projects/Week_Thirteen/index.html)
A reimagining of board game [*Battleship*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)), but with moving targets and a secret message. The title is *Battleship on Foot* (*BoF*), but your pieces now take up single spaces and can move one space each turn. Each side has three pieces. Additionally, when a space is hit by an attack, it becomes impassable, and each attack gives clues about nearby pieces.

Excerpts from the reflection:
> Anyway, I have external literature to back up what I aimed for this week. 😋 The most obvious is Ian Bogost's [*Persuasive Games*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262514880/persuasive-games/), specifically in how narrative theming and gameplay interweave to create arguments (or even tension, although this risks resurrecting a term game scholars despise: "[ludonarrative dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludonarrative_dissonance)"). Bogost is of course focused more on the gameplay-side of things in that text, but one questions how the narrative theming can be avoided in some of the game's arguments. [Milburn et al.](https://doi.org/10.1162/desi_a_00707) have shown exactly how introducing certain narratives, and indeed studying playtest reactions to them, can create compelling player engagement within intended bounds. Further, [Mitchell et al.](https://gamestudies.org/2020/articles/mitchell_kway_neo_sim) have explored a taxonomy of "poetic gameplay," in which gameplay and narrative come together in search of the emotional drives our exercises were meant to evoke this week.

> Through the instructions, the game becomes themed: similar to [*Spec Ops: The Line*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spec_Ops:_The_Line) (studied extensively in game studies) and [*This War of Mine*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_War_of_Mine) (a little less so but there's still literature on it), *BoF* becomes a game about two sides attacking each other's civilians. The pieces are the people, and the attacks are the bombardments of enemy air, naval, and artillery units off-screen.

> If this seems grisly, good. The other two games I just referenced intentionally lean into this as well due to how many war games seem to turn war into a playground devoid of life, something just for teens to engage in for fun, and possibly lure them into military recruitment in a few short years ([Huntemann and Payne](https://www.routledge.com/Joystick-Soldiers-The-Politics-of-Play-in-Military-Video-Games/Huntemann-Payne/p/book/9780415996600)).

> There are, however, alternatives. There *must* be! Each turn, an invisible button below the instructions gains +1% opacity. The button reads "Click me to sue for peace." It's easy to miss if one becomes too engrossed in the game and never looks back down.

> By engaging in the gameplay loop, the player is implicated in the tragedy of war. By never revisiting the base assumptions, the player never realizes there is an alternative. They instead remain sucked into the "entertainment" of the game, not unlike how news media tends to keep us in an elevated state of affairs where information is sometimes confused for entertainment.

# Week 14 — Combinations
You're looking at it! This entire portfolio site is the outcome of week 14's critical making exercise. See the [home page](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/) for more detail.
