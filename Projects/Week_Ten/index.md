title: Week 10 - "What does an Appalachian game look like, ChatGPT?"
---

This week's exercise seemed the most appropriate to include in full. Below is the entirety of my reflection post, as well as all the image generations mentioned in the shared folder and the Copilot chat log.

-----

This week, I was asked to play with AI and ask it to do things with my research. A classmate a few weeks ago mentioned she thought of me when a presenter demonstrated ChatGPT's bias through asking it to talk like an Appalachian. Given how I've been trying to develop an Appalachian game studies, and how I've already done a little work with analyzing video game genres through ChatGPT in Dr. Salter's class last semester, the connection was clear as day: experiment with how different tools envision an Appalachian video game, and ask those who can talk what went into their design process.

The tools in use were ChatGPT, Copilot, Adobe Firefly, and Stable Diffusion. Between these, only the first two also handle text, and the last one was on a self-hosted instance within the homelabbing network my brother and I have set up. Due to length and discussion-worthy material, however, I'll only get into the specifics of ChatGPT and more briefly with Copilot. You can poke around [the folder of the 29 generations across these tools](https://github.com/jmlwhittington/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/edit/main/Projects/Week_Ten/Images/) and [the Copilot chat log](https://github.com/jmlwhittington/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/edit/main/Projects/Week_Ten/Chat_Log/) if you're interested.

First up: ChatGPT, the most interesting. I asked it to generate three separate montages of an "Appalachian video game," with the third one more "cartoon-y" in the style of early ‘00s platformers on consoles like the PS2. (Note the "PS2" text that emerges in the third generation.) Here are the results:

The light becoming the O in "coal" on the first generation's bottom left image caught my eye; I guess driving a truck into the mine (why?) past the "old mone" sign did too. (Also, is that an alpine jungle)? All in all, you can see themes of rustic, rural wilderness in all its majestic beauty (which I guess the train and rail helps exemplify?); mystery/horror/fear; and the stock "[mountain man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_Mountaineer)" (or "[redneck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redneck)," a now-reclaimed term of pride much like "[hillbilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly)" that outsiders may nonetheless be castigated for using, but still get away with in other fashions).

I then asked ChatGPT to design covers for these games. The first ones lacked titles, so I asked it to come up with its own and try again. Note the similar design structure across the first generation, and again between the first two covers in the second:

The mystery/horror/fear is there, but all the majesty is gone! What gives, ChatGPT? I read this as a case (pun not intended) of marketing doing exactly what it's intended to do: attract an audience with what they know in limited space. Curiously, the first generation was rated T (for teen), while the others were all M (for mature), except the last one that is what I assume to be E (for everyone). The more plainly "scary" generation led to a more adult rating, while the cartoon-y one varied because of gaming's history with subverting its assumed trivial nature.

But ChatGPT can speak for itself! Certainly, and so I intended to have it do so...after a quick detour through asking to "only respond in the manner of an Appalachian" for the rest of the conversation. You can [follow this conversational track through the lovely chat share feature](https://chatgpt.com/share/67d77f9f-1a88-800c-b412-a2352fce4552) I discovered. Needless to say, it came across as stereotypical. I can't say I'm offended, both through prior exposure to this perspective and at least a few people who actually do talk kind of like this.

What was more fascinating was when I asked it to explain why Appalachians talk like that (to which it responded still in "Appalachian fashion"). It gave the thoroughly debunked myth that we speak like "the past ain't never quite done with us, an' these hills hold onto things longer than most" because of the isolation the region has experienced, both geographically and socioculturally. I don't know about you, but we had Internet in the hills when I was growing up; the only barrier to access was poverty, something that still didn't get in the way of me experiencing it. We aren't that isolated (not any more than Montana).

"Where'd you source this information?," I asked. Still in "Appalachian," ChatGPT gave me five sources, [all](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED130511) [of](https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110197181-094) [which](https://appalachian-english.library.sc.edu/node/800.html) [were](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/American+English%3A+Dialects+and+Variation%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9781118390221) [real](https://doi.org/10.1525/aa.2002.104.2.565), but the chapter title of the second was incorrect. While I haven't read these, I'm not convinced any but one or two actually support ChatGPT's hypothesis either. Just as a brief aside, if we're so isolated and that's affected our linguistic patterns, how'd the [Southern drawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawl#Southern_drawl), an innovative feature developed in the speech of the American South, reach us? In fact, I'd argue it's maintained in Appalachia today more than the rest of the South. Anyway...

I asked ChatGPT to stop talking like this and then explain what went into its generations. Its reasoning for the first two resonated with observations I've made in compiling the [Appalachian Game Presence Repository](https://jmlwhittington.com/agpr):

**The First Two Modern Games (Semi-Realistic Dark Fantasy Style)**
- **Titles:** *Whispering Hollows* & *Echoes of the Mine*
- **Reasoning:** I wanted these games to reflect the eerie, folklore-heavy atmosphere that modern adventure and horror games often embrace. The Appalachian setting is rich with ghost stories, abandoned mines, and isolated landscapes, so I leaned into those themes.
- **Visuals:**
  - Misty mountain landscapes evoke mystery and seclusion.
  - An abandoned coal town and eerie mine hint at past tragedies and supernatural occurrences.
  - The protagonists are rugged survivors, reflecting a modern game's emphasis on survival and exploration mechanics.
  - The lighting plays a huge role—dim lanterns, glowing fog, and deep shadows enhance the unsettling atmosphere.

It came right out and uncritically said all my above observations. The second was a little more silly:
**The Third Game (Cartoonish, Early 2000s PS2-Style)**
- **Title:** *Mountain Mischief*
- **Reasoning:** For this, I wanted to capture the exaggerated, colorful aesthetic of early 3D platformers from the PS2 era, like *Jak and Daxter* or *Sly Cooper*. Many of these games featured fun, slightly mischievous protagonists with a mix of adventure and lighthearted danger, which fit well with Appalachian folklore.
- **Visuals:**
  - Low-poly, stylized textures to evoke early PS2 graphics.
  - A cartoonish protagonist, likely a young adventurer with a slingshot or some whimsical weapon.
  - Folklore creatures like goblins or spirits, but with a more playful and mischievous twist rather than outright horror.
  - Bright and exaggerated color palettes, reminiscent of how PS2 games made use of vibrant contrasts despite hardware limitations.

I love how the heavy association of folklore and Appalachian made its way here in the form of "goblins," which I guess fit the theme as scary creatures? As usual, ChatGPT's ability to notice patterns in covers I hadn't was still of appreciation outside of this. For the modern covers, it told me "darker tones, more detail, realistic lighting," and for the retro covers, "brighter, blockier text, a more stylized protagonist, and a simpler background." All this before claiming it "stay[ed] true to the Appalachian themes of folklore, mystery, and adventure." (As much as I'd love to take the honor of this being my background, and it does arise in some of my most memorable stories to tell, this was most fortunately not the case.)

I ran the same exact exercise in Copilot, and you can also [explore this chat log via a Microsoft Word document](https://github.com/jmlwhittington/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/edit/main/Projects/Week_Ten/Chat_Log/). The results were not as intriguing and verified nothing new. In further comparison, Adobe Firefly was keener on the wilds—at times, making Appalachia look like a lost village in the tropics—and Stable Diffusion emphasized rustic and rural qualities. Neither could explain their design process, but I urge you to look at the folder linked at the start of this post if you're curious.

If this post hasn't made it painfully clear, there is a give-and-take with these tools. It can accurately be described as a "process," as this week's exercise is described (Johnson and Salter, 220). This process can be seen as occurring between user and tool, whether that be mutually or separately(/antagonistically) negotiated. I don't find it valuable to pedestal the supremacy of either or take either out of the equation.

It should come as no surprise then that I disagree with Ian Demsky's ultimate conclusion. There *is* process involved in this. (The theft/labor stuff is another, not as simple, and much longer discussion upon which [Mike Cook has at least partially elaborated my feelings](https://www.possibilityspace.org/blog-capitalism/index.html). The dominant culture stuff is fair [at this time](https://www.possibilityspace.org/blog-ai-is-better/index.html).) He notes his appreciation of some of his generations and those of others, then returns to handwaving it away. AI critique is good and necessary to improve these tools or define their boundaries. Art also doesn't have to be good or agreeable to be art. At the start, he links to the Wikipedia article for Walter Benjamin's "[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Work_of_Art_in_the_Age_of_Mechanical_Reproduction)," which ironically comes to the complete opposite position of his own. I think Demsky is just too stuck in the anthropocentric frame, although he admits conflicted feelings and still using the tool months later.

As for Costanza-Chock, I appreciate that she devotes some attention to matters of class in design justice, which can incorrectly feel pitted against other areas of intersectional oppression (11). Class is one of several useful lenses for analyzing the Appalachian context. I'm partial to it, because how much discourse surrounding Appalachia is incorrectly labelled as sociocultural when it comes to factors like disparaging education/literacy levels, explicitly class factors?

ChatGPT demonstrated a blatantly biased record of several Appalachian features. It learned these from already biased records, in print and digital. Something I didn't do was challenge it, but I have done this other times. I didn't do it here because that requires knowing something is off to begin with, the entire point of which defeats using these tools for that intended purpose in the first place. How do we fix this? Conjuring up [Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's famous essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayatri_Chakravorty_Spivak#%22Can_the_Subaltern_Speak?%22), can the Appalachian even speak to correct course? Would anyone listen?

On that note, something to put in conversation with Costanza-Chock's chapter this week is Linsey McGoey's recent article, "[Hierarchies of White Ignorance and Reciprist Epistemology](https://mediatheoryjournal.org/2024/12/31/linsey-mcgoey-hierarchies-of-white-ignorance-and-reciprist-epistemology/)." Of her "three chief problems with the concept of ‘white ignorance,'" the first and third come to mind:

1. It can homogenize different forms of white privilege and obscure attention to different forms of class entitlement and class domination.

. . .

3. Ironically, it can flatter whites, perpetuating spurious assumptions of epistemic supremacy that important anti-racist scholarship seeks to dismantle.

What is McGoey's solution? "In contrast to binary epistemology, we need something that shall be termed reciprist epistemology, defined as anti-monolithic thought that embraces the hybridity of racialized, classed identities."

I bring this up because Costanza-Chock's excellent work deserves to be expanded in this way. Despite the validity of the discourse against far-right and reactionary movements, it can be far too easy to paint in black and white when we need color. Plenty of Appalachians are on the same page as the rest of us, but very rarely does this get illuminated without leaving and hiding one's origin, a painful act I've seen far too many times in others and which I explicitly reject ever doing myself. It's not new either, [from the multiethnic collaborations of union coal miners a century and more ago](https://inthesetimes.com/article/labor-union-battle-blair-mountain-coal-mines-west-virginia), [to the civil rights movement](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/690684/hillbilly-nationalists-urban-race-rebels-and-black-power---updated-and-revised-by-amy-sonnie/). It is abundantly clear to me that frameworks such as that of design justice *can* and *do* apply to the Appalachian as well as other contexts, and rather than sacrificing the core point, I'd like to believe it builds stronger ties that we need now more than ever.
