Generate me a montage of an Appalachian video game please.

I'll try to create that.

**You said:**

Can you give me another?

**You said:**

One more please.

**Copilot said:**

Sure thing! I'll create another one for you.

**You said:**

Can you design case covers for each of these three games now, side by side, in whatever generation of consoles you think best fits each one? And make sure to generate a title for each one as well and put it at the top of each cover.

**Copilot said:**

I'll try to create that.

**You said:**

That's not what I asked for. Please look back at the first three generations I had you do, design a case cover for each of them in the generation of console you think they fit best in, give them names, put those at the top of the covers, and place each cover side-by-side.

**Copilot said:**

I'll try to create that.
