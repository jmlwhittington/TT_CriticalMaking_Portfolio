### Click here for the [original basic experiment](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/Projects/Week_Twelve/sketch1.html)
Aka, a modification of a template provided by the instructor.

### Click here for the [enhanced experiment](https://jmlwhittington.github.io/TT_CriticalMaking_Portfolio/Projects/Week_Twelve/sketch2.html)
Aka, a text clicker that lets you read short stories by clicking where you want the next word to go, as well as what color and size the words might be. Assistance from ChatGPT per assignment instructions.

Excerpts from the reflection:
> I love how Johnson and Salter refer to GAI as "an 'intelligent' assistant with which to co-create" ([247-248](https://services.publishing.umich.edu/Books/C/Critical-Making-in-the-Age-of-AI3)). That relationship of mutual negotiation is key to emphasize, and I feel it's otherwise lost amidst the hype. ChatGPT allowed me to accomplish the above in a fraction of the time. Looking through the documentation took half of the total time this week for something so simple in comparison. Yet, to get here, I did have to have the background of knowledge, which was earned through activities like looking through the documentation. Thus, the first half of this exercise can best be thought of as time well spent for a better final product.

> That brings into play [Costanza-Chock's chapter](https://designjustice.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/cfohnud7/release/4?readingCollection=9eadecb0). In discussing the Tech for Social Justice (T4SJ) Project's recommendations, several surrounded the need to understand problems as they are rather than assuming one has all the cards already. How can one understand how and why a bug is occurring, as well as how to resolve it, if they don't understand the framework to begin with? This is the source of much frustration in working with GAI on programming projects. An example is my lack of knowledge of Java yet trying to have ChatGPT help me make a *Minecraft mod*. The most useful thing I actually gained in the experience was an incredibly basic understanding of Java through debugging errors that I didn't understand how to prompt for corrections.

> Alongside that, the T4SJ Project's last two recommendations were about not "reinventing the wheel" and "support[ing] maintenance" instead of "'innovation.'" Just as many programmers fall back on websites like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), ChatGPT can help with this research process. After all, someone else has probably encountered our exact problem before. GAI mostly helps cut down on figuring out which answers work, but most importantly on how to directly implement them. This can also reduce [tech debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt), as ChatGPT provides another set of "eyes" over the entire code in its assistance on implementation.
